With this tool, you just have to give your iso, it will do all the steps automatically without any installation. Everything is open source.

### Upcoming Changes :
- Make it a bit prettier and still good for small screens
- Unmount the original iso automatically
- Instead of creating the files on the desktop, create them in a temporary folder
- Try avoiding the need to run it as administrator
- What else? Don't hesitate to tell me !
